# EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS

## INTRODUCTION
The files to be used for this task has the details on the names and locations of Bolton medical practices that have issued prescriptions for drugs to patients, drugs that can be prescribed, including the chemical substance and product description. The dataset could be used to examine trends and patterns in Bolton's medical practicesâ€™ prescription drug usage as well as the connections between the kinds of pharmaceuticals provided and the clinics that write them.

## DATA PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
For this task to be executed, the files drugs, medical practice and prescriptions containing the different prescriptions for patients are imported into the SQL server.
A database is therefore created for these files to be imported into.

DATA TYPE USED AND JUSTIFICATION
The data type that was used for the attributes in the drug entity was Nvarchar (50) and Nvarchar (100). This is because it is a variable width character string. It is used to define the string size in bytes and can be a value from 1 through 8,000 Unicode data.
Nvarchar (50) and Nvarchar (100) were used for the BNF_CODE, CHEMICAL_SUBSTANCE_BNF_DESCR, BNF_DESCRIPTION and BNF_CHAPTER_PLUS_CODE password because it is designed to cover all the characters of all languages. The drugs file for the prescriptions has been successfully updated into the SQL server.

The BNF_CODE attribute was made the primary key for this table. This is because the BNF_CODE is a unique identifier for the columns in the drug table and this column does not have NULL values.
We can use the SELECT statement to view the values in the drug table.

## DATA TYPE USED AND JUSTIFICATION

The data type that was used for the attributes in the drug entity was Nvarchar (50) This is because it is a variable width character string. It is used to define the string size in bytes and can be a value from 1 through 8,000 Unicode data.
Nvarchar (50) was used for practice_code, practice name, address_1, address_2, address_3, address_4 and postcode because it is a unicode datatype that is designed to cover all the characters of all languages. NULL values were allowed in address_2, address_3, address_4 because not all addresses have these details.

![image](https://github.com/Orlawlardey/EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS/assets/124607057/13612901-7029-4a56-9fd2-f8d85da65b4c)

## DATA TYPE USED AND JUSTIFICATION

The int data type is the primary integer data type in SQL Server. It stores whole numbers that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 for 9 or 10 digits of precision. The int data type was used for the prescription code and the items column because of the range of numbers in every prescription code and the number of items in each row in the item column.

The nvarchar(50) data type was used for the practice code and the bnf code column. This is because the nvarchar (50) is a unicode datatype that is designed to cover all the characters of all languages. 

The float data type was used as the data type for the quantity column to represent numbers more precisely than whole numbers. The float data type is used to store decimal or fractional numbers. The float data type was used in the quantity column because the column consists of both whole numbers and decimal numbers.
The money data type was used for the actual cost column. The money data type is used to record fixed-precision and fixed-scale monetary values. The money data type can store values up to 19 digits in length, with 4 of those digits to the right of the decimal point. This data type was used for the actual cost column because the money data type eliminates the possibility of rounding mistakes or data loss because of accuracy problems and ensures that calculations involving monetary values are correct and consistent.

The prescription code column was used as the primary key because it has all unique values, and it can be used as a unique identifier for other columns on the prescription table.
The SELECT statement was used to view the values contained in the prescription table.

![image](https://github.com/Orlawlardey/EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS/assets/124607057/2d7f10df-450b-4d76-9223-4f09b1d3482a)


![image](https://github.com/Orlawlardey/EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS/assets/124607057/6beb38f7-f5b3-4716-a54c-06b1bdc0ab34)


On the prescriptions table, two foreign keys were added to ensure that the medical practice table is properly linked to the prescription table and the drugs table is linked to the prescription table.
The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the PRACTICE_CODE column in the prescriptions table match the values in the PRACTICE_CODE column in the medical practice table while the foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the BNF_CODE column in the prescriptions table match the values in the BNF_CODE column in the drugs table.
The foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity between the prescriptions and the medical practice table and the prescription and the drugs table.

## ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM BETWEEN THE TABLES

![image](https://github.com/Orlawlardey/EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS/assets/124607057/6f00c52a-b334-45ee-9d8b-b6c1f16bbd4b)


From this diagram we can infer that the prescriptions table is related to both the medical practice table and the drugs table. This is because the rows on the prescription table can be linked to the medical practice table using the practice code column. Also, because the prescription table can be linked to the drugs table using the BNF_CODE column.

## DETAILS OF DRUGS IN FORM OF TABLETS OR CAPSULES

![image](https://github.com/Orlawlardey/EXAMINING-THE-TRENDS-AND-PATTERNS-IN-BOLTON-S-MEDICAL-PRACTICES-DRUG-PRESCRIPTIONS/assets/124607057/e41de375-01b4-48a7-af2e-307e07e7c1fb)


SELECT statement was used to select FROM the drugs table. WHERE statement was used to retrieve information from the BNF_DESCRIPTION column on the drug table. The LIKE and OR function was used to retrieve words on like tablets or capsules present in the name of the drugs in every row in the BNF_DESCRIPTION column.
